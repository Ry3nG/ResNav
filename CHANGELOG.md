- **Constants**: Centralized configuration system with environment, robot, and sensor parameters

#### Maps & Path Generation
- **S-Path Generator**: `make_s_map()` for creating sinusoidal test trajectories
- **Map Infrastructure**: Base classes and utilities for procedural map generation

#### Controllers (Baselines)
- **Pure Pursuit + APF**: Classical path-following with artificial potential fields

#### Reward System
- **Navigation Rewards**: Multi-component reward function including:
  - Path progress rewards
  - Collision penalties with exponential distance scaling
  - Lateral and heading deviation penalties
  - Velocity smoothness incentives
  - Goal reaching bonuses

#### Scripts & Utilities
- **Baseline Evaluation**: `baseline_eval.py` for systematic controller assessment
